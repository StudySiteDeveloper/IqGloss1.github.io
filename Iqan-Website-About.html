            <h1 class="art-header"> Significance of Religion Increasing </h1>

          <section class="art-text">
The one thing that nobody expected in the 21st century was the return of religion to the centerstage of global interest. This reawakened interest in religion is far from having reached its peak, in eitherits clear religious or its less definable spiritual manifestations. Increasing globalization has led to the mingling of different races and creeds and thrown people with a given religious background into close contact with others whose beliefs and practices appear totally different from their own.This automatically leads to a questioning of established, traditional religious doctrines, and more and more people are asking what religion in reality is and what they should believe in.

This development also affects those with a non-religious world view who are more and more confronted with this rising significance of religion. If fair-minded, they realize that secular ideologiessuch as materialism or communism have in some cases caused impressive material progress.But only a small privileged minority of the world population have been ableto profit from these breakthroughs. On a global scale the results of this materialist enterprise are rather disillusioning: Although man can produce enough food to feed everyone on Earth, although he has found therapies for many diseases, a large part of the human family is still starving from famine, and in many countries people still die from diseases of which the therapies have been discovered long ago. Worst of all,due to the unleashed deployment of technology with focus on consumerism has initiated in a global climate shift with unknown implications for the planet and its inhabitants.With increasing globalization adherents of materialist ideas more and more sea that this type of ideas are more prevalent among the small privileged minority mentioned above. Large portions of the world population still follow a religion as the ultimate authority in their life; for them the slogan "God is Dead" has passed away mainly unnoticed and been obsolete.

The failure of the materialist ideologies to deliver what they promised in the beginning of the last century and the questioning of established religious doctrines due to globalization have raised many questions concerning religion, some known from ancient times and some genuinely new in the context of the scientific progress of the last 150 years:
•	What is religion as such and what does it stand for?
•	Is it a set of rigid, old-fashioned beliefs contradicting modern scientific experience, is it something for the "mentally needy"?
•	Is religion an individualistic search for meaning, an attitude to life, a sense of relationship with a metaphysical reality?
•	Why are there so many contradictions between the Writings of the different religions?
•	What is the "sound" understanding of religion that would help those who believe in general human values to counter religious extremism?
•	Is religion "right" or science?
•	Which of the religions is the "true" one?
•	With humanity coming of age, to whom do we apply for spiritual guidance?

            <h1 class="art-header"> Traditional and Secular Understanding of Religion Insufficient for Today’s Needs </h1>

          <section class="art-text">

It turns out that the established religious traditions and doctrines cannot answer these questions. Millenniums of work on theological dogmas did not result in answers that were accepted as convincing by the majority of the human family. Instead, traditional theology resulted in deep trenches among the religions, helped to bring up wars and started a fight against modern science that it could not win and was in the end badly defeated. All this has severed people's trust in traditional religion and massivelydamaged its authority. Modern academic religious studies with its methods inspired by secular sciences and the interfaith movement focusing on discovering values held in common proved helpful in identifying many tenets shared between the different religions. They also successfully unmasked many articles of belief inhibiting progressas dogmatic aberrations,e.g. the superiority of one's own religion as well as Holy Wars against members of other faiths. But in the end, they could give no conclusive answer as to what religion is and fill this gap.

Our situation today is comparable to Renaissance, when humanity realized more and more that antique views of the cosmos like the geocentric world view were no longer tenable and replaced them by completely new views such as the heliocentric view which turned out to be compliant to the physical reality in the solar system.

Today, a fundamentally novel understanding of religion is necessary that has the potential to reconcile the contradictions among the religions as well as the conflicts between religious and scientific or secular interpretations of reality. This understanding must be acceptable on a global scale for people with different religious and secular backgrounds–be they “liberal” individual seekers or “devout” members of organized religious groups, be they adherents of egalitarian secular views from the “left” or more conservatives from the “right”. Then and only then, it can contribute to unifying mankind and advancing our civilization.

Coming to such an understanding is a matter of urgency, as the first drastic consequences of failing to do so are already visible. To mention only one example: people with spiritual thirst, especially young idealistic kids are being drawn to religious extremismand turned into murderers, guided by leaders who use religion as a cloak of sanctity spread over their naked pursuit of power. There is a serious risk that this results in a war of civilizations whose defining character isirreconcilable religious antipathies. Characteristics for all opponents in this conflict is lacking knowledge on the true nature of religion or to put in bold words “religious illiteracy”.

<h1 class="art-header"> A Novel View on Religion –One Common Faith Revealed in Stages</h1>

<section class="art-text">

Conventionally, different religions are seen as multiple, distinct sectarian phenomena standing beside each other. This applies both to religious as well as secular world views on religion.

A novel approach would be to treat religions as if they were the same phenomenon occurred – or revealed – at different places of the world, at different points of time in human history. Going this way, the Holy Writings and Sayings of the Founders of different religions appear as if they were “One Book” coming from “One Source” and “One Author”. In modern scientific terminology, they appear as one text corpus. What we call today Jewish, Christian, … Holy Book would be a chapter of this “One Book”. Doing so, one immediately sees that these chapters support, reinforce and elucidate one another in many topics. One will also see that they comply with the principles of general human reason reflected in the works of great philosophers, scientists and leaders that significantly contributed to the advancement of human civilization.In this perspective, the different religions appear as individual stages of one eternal changeless Faith of God and compatible with human common sense.
What in traditional understandingis called religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Islam are but individual stages in the limitless unfolding of this one single Faith of God. At the core of this Faith are values and virtues such as love, forgiveness, compassion self-sacrifice, honesty or charity to name a few. This eternal core never changes. On the other hand, ordinance and practices such as the JewishHalakha or the Islamic Sharia are transitory features, they are part of the individual stages of this one eternal, changeless Faith of God but not part of its core. With the unfoldment of this One Faith, these features are adapted once they have fulfilled their social or historic purpose. The different laws on food, marriage and divorce or usury may serve as examples.It is this One Faith unfolding in the course of history of mankind that is called “the River of Truth” in early Christian literature, it is this faith,the adherents of which like Noah or the Disciples are called Muslims in the Quran.

In a globalized planet, this concept proves to be very effective in both explaining the differences between the religions as well as helping to overcome the barriers between them: As there is - according to all religions - only one God and one Humanity, there must be One Common Faith behind what we call religion(s).

Objective of this website is to demonstrate the evolution of this One Common Faith and its continuous unfoldment during human history, by gathering material from different religions and putting them side by side, so that interested readers coming either from secular or religious backgrounds can see that for themselves. The material is meant to support the readers to find answers to questions on faith and spirituality that may move them to rethink their view on religion, culture and history and find their own way of contributing to a true uniting of the ONE mankind.

 <h1 class="art-header"> Methodical Approach of this Website </h1>
              
The material collected mainly concerns four stages of the evolution of this Eternal Faith or four religionsin today's understanding. It is gathered from the Hebrew Scriptures, the Gospel, the Quran, and the Bahá'í Writings.The first three are selected because of the contradictions between their interpretations of their Writings, the wars between their adherents during history and the heavy opposition they showed towards science, progress and modernity. Demonstrating how the One Common Faith is reflected in these three religions surely will more contribute to re-establishingtrust in religions than doing so for religions that have a peaceful image like Buddhism. The Bahá’í Faith is selected because of the prominent position the unity of religions has in its Writings. Innumerable passages of the Hebrew scriptures, the Gospel and the Quran are interpreted in the Bahá’í texts showing, how The Eternal Divine Faith stagewise evolved in and through these three books. 

Among the Bahá’í Writings it is the Book of Certitude that has the strongest focus on the One Common Faith underlying the different religions we see today. Therefore, this website will pull together material from the Jewish, Christian and Muslim Writings following the sequence of topics treated in the Book of Certitude. Doing so, it will strictly distinguish between the Holy Writings, i.e. texts or sayings attributed to the Prophet-Founders of the religions and their authorized interpreters or successors, and the secondary literature such as theological works or reference works produced by great thinkers or scientists.To sum up, the methodological approach of this website is:

1.	Following the paragraphs of Bahá'ú'lláhs Book of Certitude, the interpretations given there are put together with the respective texts from the Hebrew Bible, the Gospel and the Quran and when applicable with background information from established scholarly reference works.
2.	The common interpretation thus supported by the four Holy Writings is then complemented by texts from the secondary literature of these religions.
3.	In important cases, such as doctrines concerning the finality and superiority of one religion, differences between the commentary literature and the Holy Writings under 1. are contrasted. Whenever possible using modern scientific literature it will be shown when and how the religious secondary literature started to diverge form the Holy Writing.
4.	Results of modern sciences such as sociology, mathematics, physics and astronomy are also quoted when they fit and when they can be simply described for a broad audience. This is only done as to build a bridge for readers with secular background and not as a proof for the truth of religions.
5.	The secondary literature is drawn from sources which are generally well establishedand respected by people both from religious or secular backgrounds. All sources are mentioned in the footnotes. Those repeatedly quoted are mentioned in the references list.
6.	Topics that may hurt religious feelings, e.g. polemic attacks against the Prophets of God, are only briefly touched in the articles, when there is a compelling reason to do so, e.g. because they are mentioned in the Book of Certitude. However, due to scientific obligation, the sources are declared in the foot notes.
7.	Transliteration is done following the Bahá'í transliteration system as this system is deliberately designed for the need of a wide audience which has no training in Oriental Languages. Words having become part of the English language such as Imam, Hajj, Quran are not transliterated.
8.	To make this site accessible and easy to download for any reader, anywhere in world, pictures or drawings are used when there is a compelling reason to do so. 
9.	When Holy Writings are quoted translations approved by the respective religious institutions are used. If these are not available as e.g. in case of the Quran, well accepted translations are used as declared in the reference list. 
10.	The secondary literature is quoted using established, proven translations as declared in the reference list. If these are not available, the text is summarized. When it appears to be helpful for the reader, the original text is quoted in the footnotes.
11.	The authorwill be glad to make any improvements in the articles. Kindly use the contact form mentioning the article, the point of improvement and your suggestions. The more precise and constructive your suggestion, the faster it will be implemented.
