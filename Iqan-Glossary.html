                  In the Torah the term refers to the tent where God dwelt among the Israelites, where He spoke with Moses and where the ark of covenant between God and man were stored. Entering the tabernacle required purification. In the Gospel the Covenant between God and man is renewed in the heavenly tabernacle by Christ. The Íqán generalizes the Gospel’s interpretation of these symbols as a reference to the Covenant between every Manifestation of God and His followers, that they accept the next Manifestation when He appears. In the introduction of the Íqán, entering the tabernacle stands for fulfilling this covenant, i.e. understanding the true station of all Manifestations from the symbols used in past Holy Writings and, as a result, recognizing the announced next Manifestations of God. This can only be attained by those purified from vain imaginings, e.g. traditional misconceptions about God, prophets and religion.

                  <span class="art-subtitle"> The symbolism of the Torah </span><br /> 
                  Tabernacle (from Lat. tabernaculum for tent; taberna for hut) refers to the portable sanctuary constructed by the Children of Israel in the wilderness at the command of God. The tabernacle also contained the tablets of the covenant (Ex. 40:3). It is described in the Torah as: (EJ 2)
                 <ul>
                      <li>the dwelling place of the Lord (<i>Mishkan</i>) among the Israelites (Ex. 25:8), symbolized by the sanctuary, <i>Miqdash</i> (Ex 25:8), or Holy Place, <i>ha-Qodesh</i> (Ex 28:29)</li>
                      <li>the place where the Divine Presence was revealed <i>ʾOhel Moʿed</i> (Ex 28:43) and where the cloud of the Lord appeared over the propitiatory (Lev. 16:2), at the entrance to the tent (Num. 16:19) or over the Tent of Meeting with the glory of god filling it (Ex. 40:34). It was here that God spoke with Moses (Ex. 25:22). The term for this function of the tabernacle, tent of meeting, occurs about 150 times in the Bible</li>
                      <li>the center of Israel’s cultus, e.g. the great Day of Atonement, the one day in the year when the high priest was permitted to enter the Holy of Holies, <i>Qodesh ha-Qodashim</i></li>
                  </ul>
                                    
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Interpretation in Gospel </span><br />
                  In the Gospel Christ acts as a high priest in the true heavenly tabernacle, renewing God’s covenant with man. The earthly tabernacle described in the Torah appears an image of the for the tent Moses built (Hebrews 8:1-6). The tabernacle will find its fulfilment in the New Jerusalem descending down from Heaven, prepared by God. Then again, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them (Rev 21:3) (LdB <i>Stiftshütte</i>, NEB Hebr. 11:10). On two occasions, the Gospel  the dual symbols of cloud and glory or light are found in the Gosepl: in the context of Christ’s return on a cloud (Mk 13:26, Mt 24:30, Lk 21:27) and in the transfiguration accounts (Mt 17:1–8, Mk 9:2–8, Lk 9:28–36).
                  

                  <p></p>
                  
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Universalization in the Book of Certitude</span><br />
                  In the Book of Certitude the interpretation of the Gospel is generalized, and the term tabernacle applied to all Manifestations of God. All are called God’s tabernacle shedding illumination on mankind (KI 99), which corresponds to the Torah’s description of the tabernacle being filled with the glory. As the Manifestations are the perfect mirrors sending out the light of God, being in their presence is like being in God’s presence (KI 151). Thus, God is present or dwells among man in His Manifestation, in a figurative sense in His tabernacle, as mentioned in the Torah. On His behalf all Manifestations have foretold the coming of yet another Prophet after them (KI 13), made a covenant with their people that they follow their successor (BWF 357, Towfigh 39, EBF) and have established signs that announce the advent of the future Dispensation (KI 13). This is one interpretation of the ark of covenant stored in the tabernacle. <p></p>
                  
                  Another aspect of the covenant are the laws that every Manifestation reveals to advance civilization. Often, these contradict the tradition of the people (KI 79). Besides the Prophets appear in normal human form (KI 74) and are subject to the same limitations as other humans (KI 74); some of them are even killed. This runs contrary to the people’s expectations, so that they do not recognize the Prophet’s spiritual attributes (KI 79-80). Like clouds hindering men from seeing the sun, these contradictions to their expectations prevent people from seeing the divine qualities of the Prophets (KI 80). This is one interpretation of the cloud enshrouding the tabernacle in the Torah, a symbol which also occurs in the Gospel in the context of Christ’s return on a cloud (Mk 13:26, Mt 24:30, Lk 21:27). Those who manage to push these clouds aside or - to use another symbol - tear these veils apart, recognize the Manifestation of God, fulfill the covenant and enter the tabernacle that is erected in the Holy Writings of the Báb in particular and the Prophets of the past in general which is here designated as (<a class="art-href" href="#iq1.2-bayan">Bayán</a>). 
                  

                  <p></p><span class="art-subtitle"> The Persian term used by Bahá’u’lláh for Tabernacle</span><br />
                  <figure class="art-img" >
                      <img src="Pics-Iqan-Glossary/herrschaftlicheszelt2.jpg" title="Darstellung 2. Ein herrschaftliches Zelt von innen." alt="herrschaftlicheszelt1.jpg">
                      <figcaption class="art-fig-caption"> Royal Tent<sup></sup></figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  The most critical barrier to recognizing the true station of the Manifestations of God are misconceptions about God, the Prophets or Religion that one has taken over from his environment. The Arabic-Persian term that Baháu’lláh uses reflects this point. The Íqán uses for tabernacle the Arabic term <i>surádiq</i> which denotes a space delimited by a cloth of wool. Inside this space the tent of the ruler were pitched. This space is guarded by sentinels, so nobody can enter without permission. Later the term came to also denote royal tent (Duran) or a cloth tent of quite large dimensions (EI2 <i><u>kh</u>ayma</i>) as used by kings e.g. when they and their entourage went out hunting or when celebrating marriage of their children.The function of the <i>surádiq</i> was to separate the space dedicated to the king, khan or sultan from the rest of the camp. In some instances, this imperial tent was surrounded by an enclosure supported by lances planted in the ground. 
                  
                  <p>The word <i>surádiq</i> is believed to come from the Persian <i>sarápardih</i> (ASA IV, FVQ, Eilers) for a veil or curtain, especially at the door or at a royal palace or pavilion; a wall of canvas surrounding a cluster of tents or a royal court in general.  To enter a distinguished place like the <i>surádiq</i> one has to prepare by asking the ruler for authorization, wearing appropriate clothing etc. and once inside one must show deep humbleness, e.g. by kissing the ground in front of the king (Durand, Eilers). Likewise, entering the tabernacle requires preparation like washing hands and feet (Ex. 40:31-32). <i>Surádiq</i> is often used metaphorically in the Bahá’í Writings (ASA IV) and translated as pavilion, canopy, dome or tabernacle. Bahá’u’lláh uses it in many instances as a symbol for exalted stations in the spiritual worlds that are covered by veils from the eyes of human beings and inhabited by the Chosen Ones of God(TSR 90, 168). In the Qur’an 18:28-29 <i>surádiq</i> stands for a cover of smoke in the shape of a tent surrounding those who have been “neglectful of our remebrance”, i.e. not followed the Manifestation of God. It is difficult for them to find their way back to the straight path through this smoke(ADQ).</p>

                  Arabic term meaning explanation, expounding, elucidation. In a more specific sense, it refers to the Persian Bayán, the most important Book of the Báb, which contains numerous references to “Him Whom God will make manifest” and is completed by Bahá’u’lláh as the Promised One of the Bayán. In a more general sense it occurs in the Koran in the sense of revealing the inner meaning of the Holy Writings and their obscure symbols on the promised Day of Resurrection. This concept is also found in the Gospel that uses Greek terms related to interpretation or teaching. The Hebrew Bible uses the metaphor of breaking the seals.

                  <p>The term <i>Bayán</i> is a noun common to Arabic and Persian meaning “statement,” “exposition,” “explanation.” From an early date onward, it also encompassed the various arts of expression in speech and writing (EIR). </p>

                  </figure>
                  Bayán, on the one hand denotes the whole revelation of the Báb (D71), on the other hand it is the title of two of His important Books: the Persian Bayán, which is his most important book or Mother Book as He called it, and the Arabic Bayán. The Persian Bayán is a full expression of the Bábs’s teachings, together with the laws and precepts of His Dispensation. Most importantly, it contains innumerable references to “Him Whom God will make manifest” and from a Bahá’í perspective is “primarily regarded as an eulogy of The Promised One” (D 72, 167, EIR). In fact, the text contains more references to the Promised Messenger than teachings and commandments and  makes clear that the Promised One will appear in the form of a human temple (Afnan). The Báb had left the Bayán unfinished and prophesied that the promised one would complete it, “though not in its actual form, but only spiritually in the form of another Book. The ‘Íqán’ is believed to be its continuation”(D 9). This is reflected in the  <a class="art-href" href="#iq2.1-essence">structure of the Book of Certitude</a>.<p></p>
                  
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> The term Bayán in the Koran</span><br />
                  Like other Holy Books, the Koran contains prophecies and predictions of events that will take place in the world and which everybody will see and witness. These include prophecies that the sun will be rolled up, the moon darkened, The stores scattered, the heavens Cliff this under and the skies rolled up. The earth will quake, the mountains crumble etc. Obviously, the true interpretation of the verses cannot be their literal meaning. They have to be interpreted symbolically. Explaining this concealed significance is called <i>bayán</i> on in the Koran: then it is ours to explain (<i>bayán</i>) it (75:19). According to the Koran, no one knows the interpretation of these secret meanings “except god and those Who are well-grounded in knowledge”(Q 3:7), and these meanings will be disclosed on the day of resurrection. (M&amp;M 57) <p></p>
                  
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Bayán in Gospel</span><br />
                  Similarly, concerning the general audience, Christ concealed the events linked to the kingdom of God in parables (Mt 1:34-35) and promised that the truth behind theem will be disclosed “when the spirit of truth comes” (Joh 16:12). For his disciples He also interpreted the obscure meaning of different passages of the old testament for his disciples: “And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.” (Luke 24: 27). The term Luke uses here for expounding is <i>diermēneu</i> and means to interpret, to express concealed substance, to explain something that is closed  (EWNT <i>ἑρμηνεύω</i>) and has the same connotation as <i>bayán</i> in the above-mentioned verses of the Koran.<p></p>

                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Bayán in HebrewBible</span><br />
                  Similarly in the Hebrew Bible the prophet Daniel is told to seal the symbols until the times of the ends when their meaning is laid open: But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. (Dan 12:4).<p></p>
                  
                  <p>Leading Scholars, both in Christianbity and Islam have pointed out that the writings are concealed to address the different capacity of poeple to understand them (Origen, Peri Archon III,I,16) and as-Shurawardí who in his <i>Temples of Light</i> states that revelation was entrusted to the prophets and its elucidation was delegated to the great the Comforter Who will appear once Christ has gone (M&amp;M 54).</p>

			  <section class="art-summary"> The Bahá’í see the Book of Certitude as the continuation of the Bayán, the Mother Book of the Báb. This is reflected in the Íqán’s structure that consist of two parts. Like in the Bayán, both parts start with an Arabic paragraph that set out their general theme and is  expounded in the following Persian paragraph. The last paragraph of both parts contains a statement saying the fruit of studying them is to recognize the Promised One of the Persian Bayán.

                  <p>The Persian and Arabic Bayán were envisaged as consisting of nineteen unities, called <i>váḥid</i>, each one made of nineteen chapters, designated <i>báb</i>. However, both were left incomplete and stop in their ninth and eleventh unity, respectively. The Báb left the completion over to the Promised One, who in the Bayán is often eulogized as “Him, Whom God will make manifest” (Arab. <i>man yuzḥiruhu’lláh</i>). The Bahá’í believe the Book of Certitude to be its continuation and completion (LOG 1544) by Bahá’u’lláh as the Promised One of the faith of Báb as well as other Holy Writings. </p>
                  
                  <p>As a result the Kitáb-i-Íqan has a similar structure of to that of the Bayán. All chapters of the Persian Bayán have a common form, beginning with the paragraph in Arabic summarizing the key theme. This is followed by a long and elaborate explication in Persian. When the main text of the chapter finishes with a statement concerning the “fruit” or purpose of the chapter. The structure of the Book of Certitude is the similar: it has two parts each beginning with a summary paragraph in Arabic which is expounded in the following Persian Paragraph, followed by the main text. Both parts finish with a statement that their purpose is to dispel whatever may cause people to turn away from the Promised One (LAC 128). This summarizing second Persian paragraph starts with the words “The essence of these words is” which written in red in the manuscript depicted on the left.</p>

                  <p>The 19 units of the Bayán stand for the Báb and His disciples, called the Letters of the Living, or 19 letters of the first verse of the Koran “In the name of God, the most compassionate, the merciful” (Arab. <i>bismilláḥi’r-raḥmáni’r-raḥím</i>) which in Arabic has 19 letters and occurs at the beginning of every sura except the ninth. According to various Islamic Hadiths, all spiritual truth revealed in the Holy Scriptures is contained within this verse, and all the truth hidden in this verse lies in its first letter which in Arabic is a <i>b</i> (Arab. ب). The <i>ب</i> is the second letter of the Arabic Alphabet and has the numerical value of 2. Thus, the 19 unities of the Bayán are present in the letter <i>b</i>, as they are reflected in the 2 parts of the Book of Certitude which is thus the fulfilment and completion of the Bayán (LAC 130, D 70).</p>

              <p class="art-title"> §2  certitude </p>
			  
			  <section class="art-summary"> The human soul’s attainment of certitude is a is central theme in all religions. In the Bahá’í Holy Writing it is extensively treated and it was Bahá’u’lláh Himself Who choose the title Book of Certitude for his principal doctrinal work. In the Philosophy the term certitude generally is related to the intellect and implies having no doubt as to a proposition. In the Holy Writings, especially in Íqán, certitude is more than an intellectual issue. It is related to the human soul and besides recognizing something as true, it also covers aspects such as being firm in faith, the relation, especially trust into God and His Manifestation, as well as acting according to the laws and admonitions of the Manifestation. This way the faithful comes to a state of inner peace and freedom.

                  <span class="art-subtitle"> The term</span><br />
                  Certitude comes from French <i>certitude</i> for “certainty” and Latin <i>certitūdinem</i>. It means “subjective certainty; the state of being certain or sure of anything; assured conviction of the mind that the facts are so and so; absence of doubt or hesitation” (OED) and is related to intellectual certainty that a proposition is true. Analysis of the relevant entries in philosophical dictionaries shows that there is no  uniform use for the terms certitude (as well as certainty) in the literature. Generally certitude refers to a subjective judgement or conviction (CDP, REP, SEP). For certitude to exist in the mind, it is sufficient that the cause from which it arises be of such a nature as to exclude all fear of the opposite. Certainty, on the other hand refers to the alleged indubitably of certain truths, especially of logic and mathematics, and requires the intellect to fully grasp that which it knows (Runes). Or to bring it down to the point: “While the mind seeks intellectual certainty, what the soul longs for is the attainment of certitude” (OCF 12.5).
                  
                  <p>In the Holy Writings the soul appears as the driving force of the different rational faculties like analytical skills, creativity, sense of judgement as well as virtues like love, forbearance, compassion, etc. One can imagine the soul as the sun and the mental faculties as its rays to get an impression of the different levels addressed by the certitude in the Holy Writings and certitude/certainty in the writings of most philosophers. Certitude addresses the whole sun, certainty only some of its rays.</p>
                  
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Certitude in the Bahá’í Writings</span><br />
                  Certitude is an important theme found not only in the Íqán, but also throughout the Bahá’í Writings. The fact that Bahá’u’lláh Himself choose the title Book of <i>Certitude</i> for His  most important doctrinal text emphasizes the importance of this subject.(D 72)

                  Realization of certitude touches the whole soul and is not only about conviction that a proposition, statement or a claim is true, it requires also that this conviction is reflected in the behavior and life of the person. Attaining certitude must result in adorning human life with divine perfections (AVK III 5) as Abdu’l-Bahá says. As a model He mentions Bahá’í who once having gained certitude in the teachings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh started to ennoble their character. Referring to one of them He says: “He had been a slave to his senses, now he was a thrall of God. He had been clay and earthenware before, now he was a dear-bought pearl; a dull and lusterless stone before, now a ruby glowing. Even among the non believers, people were astonished at the change.” (MOF Ch 48)<p></p>
                  
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Certitude in the Koran</span><br />
                  The Arabic term for certitude is <i>íqán</i> and occurs right in the beginning of the main text of the Koran. Sura 2:4 makes clear that this Holy Book addresses those who “<i>firmly believe</i>” in the Hereafter. Here the Koran uses the word <i>yuqinún</i> which is the present tense from, 3rd person plural, of <i>íqán</i>. The root of this word is y-q-n with the infinitive <i>yaqín</i> which is translated as to be certain, conviction, unshakable belief, spiritual certitude. Derivatives of <i>yaqín</i> occur 28 times in Koran (ADQ <i>y-q-n</i>, SQ 6:73), e.g. in
                  <ul>
                       <li><span class=art-quote> And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith]</span>(6:75)</li>
                       <li><span class=art-quote> ... as a trial ... that those who were given the Scripture will be convinced (<i>yastayqina</i>) and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt</span>(6:75)</li>
                  </ul>
                                    
                  <span class="art-subtitle"> Certitude in the Gospel</span><br />
                  Heree, the concept of certitude is mentioned in symbols  
                  <ul>
                       <li><span class=art-quote> for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you. </span>(Mt 17:20)</li>
                       <li><span class=art-quote> Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth</span>(Mk 9:23)</li>
                       <li><span class=art-quote> And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</span>(Lk 17:6)</li>
                  </ul>
                  The Greek term used here is <i>pistis</i> (<i>πίστις</i>) which means conviction of religious truth, reliance upon Christ and constancy in such profession. It is used with the predominate idea of trust. It also refers to the character of person who can be relied on (SN 4102). It also stands for the appropriate relation to God and Christ and was hardly used in profane context (EWNT).
                  
                  The removing of the mountain is not meant literally. The metaphor is of Rabbinic origin. In the times of Christ the 
                  Jews used to set out those teachers among them, that were more eminent for the profoundness of their learning, or the splendour of their virtues, by such expressions as this; He is a rooter up (or a remover) of mountains (LFT). Making a mountain moves also implies firmness in action, that one does not change his stance even despite sever difficulties (BIL I). This is consistent with Abdu’l-Bahá’s interpreting the crumbling of mountains in the time of the end: It stands for famous souls whom people consider to be as big as mountains and who crumble, i.e. whose fame sinks into oblivion, when the new Manifestation appears (AVK III 5).

                  <p>An example for an influential Christian Thinker who has expressed similar views is Bonaventura (Emgl. Bonaventure). His theory of illumination aims to account for the certitude of human knowledge. He argues that there can be no certain knowledge unless the knower is infallible and what is known cannot change. Because the human mind cannot be entirely infallible through its own power, it needs the cooperation of God, even as it needs God as the source of immutable truths. Sense experience does not suffice, for it cannot reveal that what is true could not possibly be otherwise; so, in Bonaventure’s view, the human mind attains certainty about the world only when it understands it in light of the ‘eternal reasons’ or divine ideas. This illumination from God, while necessary for certainty, ordinarily proceeds without a person’s being conscious of it (REP).</p>
